INTRODUCTION

1.1 System Introduction



Inventory Ahead is a project in web2py framework that manages and control the inventory of the store. 

The portal helps to automate and maintain the records on the basis of quantity,value etc.of a store that sells items like laptops, desktops etc. 

The calculations are made very quickly and the records are directly saved into databases and the databases can be maintained for a longer period of time. 

Each record can be retrieved and can be verified for the future transactions. Reports are also generated on the daily basis to keep track of the trasactions.

This system also provides high level of security as only admin people have the full access to the database. 

There are operator logins for cashier and manager through which operator can manage purchases and sales of the inventory. Limited access is available to the 	operators.
